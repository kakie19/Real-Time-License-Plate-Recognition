# Vehicle License Plate Recognition System

## Team: Tech Titans

### Project Overview

The **Vehicle License Plate Recognition System** developed by **Tech Titans** is designed to facilitate real-time monitoring and recognition of vehicle license plates. Leveraging deep learning models, the system not only detects vehicles in each frame but also identifies and recognizes the license plates accurately.

### Features

#### Real-time License Plate Detection and Recognition
Our system processes video streams in real-time, identifying and recognizing license plates swiftly and efficiently.

#### Vehicle Classification
Identifying whether the vehicle is a car, motorcycle, bus, or truck, our system provides classification data along with the recognized license plate details.

#### High Accuracy
Utilizing the prowess of deep learning models, our system ensures high accuracy in recognizing license plates, enhancing reliability.

#### CSV Logging
To facilitate record-keeping and data analysis, the recognized license plate details, along with additional information, are logged into a CSV file.

### Setup and Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kakie19/Real-Time-License-Plate-Recognition
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd Real-Time-License-Plate-Recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
After installing the necessary dependencies, you can start the system using the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

Ensure your system is properly configured to feed real-time video streams for processing.
